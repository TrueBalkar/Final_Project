# Configuration instructions 
Before you start using it you need to install and configure MySQL on your machine or just connect it to existing database. Then in file auction\db.py change connection data in class ConnectToDatabase to yours. After that import sql tables from sql_tables in your database. And you are pretty much ready to go.
# Installation instructions 
This will include, but is not limited to, any packages and dependencies required to make your project function.
# Operating instructions
“What is this? Where does this go?” Now is the time to demystify any assumptions around how to use your project.
# A list of files included 
Contingent upon how large your source code is, you may opt to not include the file tree, however you can still explain how to traverse through your code. For example, how is your code modularized? Did you use the MVC (Model, View, Controller) method? Did you use a Router system? Just a few questions to consider when detailing your file structure.
# Copyright and licensing information
In order to let others know what they can and cannot do with your code, it is important to include a software license in your project. If you opt out of using a license then the default copyright laws will apply and you will retain all rights to your source code and no one may reproduce, distribute, or create derivative works from your work. Hence the reason licenses are critical and highly recommended for open source projects.
# Contact information for the distributor or programmer
Name, email, social media links, and any other helpful ways of getting in contact with you or members of your team.
# Known bugs

# Troubleshooting

# Credits and acknowledgments 
Who were the contributing authors on the project, whose code did you reference, which tutorials did you watch that help you bring this project to fruition? Sharing is caring and all praises are due for those that have helped no matter how small the contribution.
# A changelog (usually for programmers) 
A changelog is a chronological list of all notable changes made to a project such as: records of changes such as bug fixes, new features, improvements, new frameworks or libraries used, and etc.
# A news section (usually for users)
